						<p class="scroll">Ren Sugie is an undergraduate student in the EIS faculty and majoring in IT. He grew up in a small town in Japan and currently resides in Wollongong, Australia. Ren went to an uncommon high school called a “commercial high school”, which concentrates more on business knowledge and skills rather than the college preparatory courses in many Japanese high schools. Through study in high school, he became interested in Information and Communication Technology. Because of this, he got a full-time job in a telecommunications company after graduating the school and learnt about the technology used in mobile phones and how they affect people’s lives. After enjoying his career in the company for several years, he decided to study abroad to deepen his knowledge in ICT businesses and to improve his career.</p>
