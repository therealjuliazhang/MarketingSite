			<p class="white-text light">We are a group of six stduents studying at the University if Wollongong that has banded together to make "Cultural Pentagon". Our name "Cultural Pentagon" may be confusing as there are six of us, however our name shows the five different cultures (Japan, Vietnam, China, Phillippines, Australia) that we represent. Our logo is a wave in a pentagon, which represents out group name. The pentagon refers to the pentagon part of our name, however the wave represents the sea or the letter "C" representing the cultural part in our name - in other words, it's a bad pun.</p>

							<p>Ren Sugie is an undergraduate student in the EIS faculty and majoring in IT. He grew up in a small town in Japan and currently resides in Wollongong, Australia. Ren went to an uncommon high school called a “commercial high school”, which concentrates more on business knowledge and skills rather than the college preparatory courses in many Japanese high schools. Through study in high school, he became interested in Information and Communication Technology. Because of this, he got a full-time job in a telecommunications company after graduating the school and learnt about the technology used in mobile phones and how they affect people’s lives. After enjoying his career in the company for several years, he decided to study abroad to deepen his knowledge in ICT businesses and to improve his career.</p>
