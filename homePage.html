			<h4>Our Project</h4>
			<p class="left-align light">
                Dr Holly Tootell’s research project aims to investigate the design process of the Jump Start application, which is a development tool on physical activity and gross motor skills for pre-schoolers and parents and educators. In order to achieve this, various tests have been conducted on paper, with results written down by hand.<br/><br/>
                Our team’s job is to make the testing and data collection process easier for the researchers.<br/><br/>
                Our proposed solution to this problem is an online web application that aims to make it convenient and efficient to conduct the tests. By using a web application we can have the tests conducetd on devices such as tablets and automatically collect data and compile results into useful graphs and tables. A web application also allows for easy deplyment to preschools and allows for instructions to be displayed through our application to inform educators on how to conducts tests.

                <h6>Researchers</h6>
                Researchers refer Dr Tootell's research team. Their role in the system will be making the tests and analysing the results provided from the tests.

            <div class="col s4">
                <h6>Pre-schoolers</h6>
                The pre-schoolers are the major focus of the research. As such they will be interacting with the system through tests in order to collect their results and behaviours.

            <div class="col s4">
                <h6>Educators</h6>
                The Educator's main role is to setup and guide the pre-schooler's through the test. Educator's are an important factor due the preschooler's being familiar with them.

            <h4>Issues</h4>
            <h6>Data Collection</h6>
            Currently the tests are conducted on paper with results written down by hand, this involves difficulty in data collecting as every result has to be recorded by hand and then transformed to be put into a database. This limits the effectiveness of how many tests can be taken and with data being physically taken it is possible for human error to occur.
            <h6>Deployability</h6>
            Currently as tests are paper the research team needs to make their way down to a preschool to deploy their tests as they need to explain to educators on how to conduct these tests and how to collect correct data. This overall limits the deployability of tests which means overall means less data for researchers to go off.

            <h4>Methodology</h4>
            <h6>Scrum</h6>
            Scrum allows the several tasks to be assigned to several members within a given time frame. It allows for constant functionalities to be implemented to ensure our client is satisfied with the function and allows for the team to adapt to changing requirements.
            <h6>Taiga.io</h6>
            Using Taiga allows for sprint planning for our scrum methodology and also enables the team to manage the tasks that need to be done. It also allows for the team to update where they are up to on a task.
